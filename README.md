# Production-grade DPO–Monte Carlo Tree of Thoughts example.

This module implements a post-training mechanism that allows a language model to
explore various reasoning branches (chain-of-thoughts) using a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) framework. It selects the branch with the best answer using a cosine
similarity evaluator that compares the candidate answer to a known correct answer.

The language model uses Hugging Face's GPT-2 (via the text-generation pipeline)
and the evaluator uses a pretrained SentenceTransformer to compute sentence embeddings.
